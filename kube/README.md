Why installing Kubernetes with Ansible or Bash, 
when you can simply do it with python3?

How to run:
```
1) modules created for different actions (updates, services installing, etc)
2) make sure that files are under same folder (or main_progr is aware of the their location when performing import)
3) chmod +x main_prog.py
4) ./main_prog.py

```

<i> this is still in progress, the k8s still needs network setup, etc</i>
